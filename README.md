# CIFAR-10-image-classification
Convolutional neural net project classifying CIFAR-10 IMAGES (10 classes)
The code should be run on GPU. For this specific project the code was run on Floydhub. Accuracy >60% with multilayer convulutional network with max pooling. Opportunties to improve include better weight initialization.
This will be a great project to understand the sensitivity of CNN to initial weight initialization and bias initialization.
